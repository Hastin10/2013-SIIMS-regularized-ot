\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a generalization of the discrete optimal transport that enables to relax the mass conservation constraint and to regularize the transport map. We showed how this novel class of transports can be applied to color transfer and that regularization is crucial to reduce noise amplification artifacts, while relaxation enables to cope with mass variation of the modes of the color palettes. We have extended these ideas to compute the relaxed and regularized barycenter of a set of input distributions. We illustrate the usefulness of this novel barycenter to perform color palette normalization of a group of input images. An interesting problem that we leave as future work is the use of the spatial localization of the pixels to further regularize the color mapping. Another important problem is the theoretical analysis of the optimal regularized $\Sig$, to somehow mimic the analysis of 1-D regularized transport to our convexified problem.
